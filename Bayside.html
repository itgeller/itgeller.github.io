   Recently many people have been looking into buying homes located in the outer borough part of Queens, which include neighborhoods such as Bayside. Unlike other Queens neighborhoods, current home prices in Bayside are much higher than the pre-pandemic prices. Renters who have been living in Bayside are facing competition from newcomers willing to pay higher prices to live in the specific neighborhood of their choosing. Because of the sudden interest in outer borough neighborhoods, those already living in Bayside are faced with higher rent, making it hard for them to afford. A study by StreetEasy shows the median home price has increased by 20% from the last year alone. In addition, renters and homeowners already occupying the area noticed a decrease in the suburban feel of the neighborhood, as more people have started to move in. With the increase in prices, renters are faced with affordability, competition, and a large change in the neighborhood they call home.
