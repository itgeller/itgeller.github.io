    <h4 id="lowincome1">Why is low income housing important in Jamaica?</h4>
    </div>
    <p id="jamaicatwo">
    In Jamaica, rent for tenants is increasing anywhere from 30% up to 60%. This is becanuse landlords are trying to match their rent prices with the current real estate market’s prices. This negatively impacts residents in areas where rent is being raised because tenants got used to the real estate prices during Covid and since minimum wage has not been raised, people must pay significantly more for housing. In addition, the decrease in affordable housing means landlords can charge more without including the cost of amenities. The increase in the cost of housing was caused by the influx of people who came to New York during Covid to take advantage of the low prices of real estate. Now the demand for housing is so high, landlords can charge absurd prices because they know people will pay them (because finding other housing is difficult). People who cannot afford Manhattan and Brooklyn move to Queens which has a slower rent increase. Consequently, those already residing in Jamaica, Queens have to pay higher rent due to the increase in demand or move to a cheaper location. This negatively impacts low income households.
