  </div>

  <p>
    As cited by the U.S Census Bureau in 2019, based on a 5 year-estimate plan, there are an estimated 39,407 people living in Queen’s neighborhood of Whitestone. Located in the zipcode location of 11357, Whitestone’s racial and ethnic composition consists of residents ranging from 56.4% identified as Asian, 15.6% identified as Hispanic, 1.7% identified as Black, and 24.3% identified as White. 40.84% of Whitestone’s residents are identified between the age range of 35-64. Of this percentage, 94.46% are employed, with a median annual household income of $85,818. With this annual income, median house value is calculated at $722,600, while median gross rent is calculated at $1,793. Some may argue that such market values meet the budget ranges for residents of Whitestone. Therefore, affordable housing in this area is inaccessible. Low income housing in the area of Whitestone is limited, with options for affordable housing only located outside of this neighborhood. Arguably Queen’s most affluent neighborhood, a change in household income within the last several years is indicative of gentrification, ultimately serving as the largest factor for limitations in housing available to low income communities. As a result, gentrification in Whitestone has led to increased demand for houses and rent pricing escalations, increasing low income communities to the vulnerability of evictions, correspondingly. It can be concluded that the reasoning for such a small percentage of unemployment recorded in this neighborhood, as well as individuals living below the poverty line, is due to the displacement of low income communities into other neighborhoods outside of Whitestone. If gentrification causes the displacement of such communities, there is bound to be an increase in employment as more affluent populations are moving into the neighborhood as others are being pushed out.

    <h4 id="lowincome2">Why is low income housing important in Whitestone?</h4>
</div>
   As a result of gentrification in recent years, affordable housing within Whitestone, Queens, is virtually inaccessible. According to the  International Socioeconomics Laboratory, there is a significant increase in household income within Whitestone, which is indicative of gentrification. Marginalized communities are faced with displacement, as they are forced to move out of their homes into other neighborhoods. One of Whitestone’s largest obstacles for low income communities is their lack of low income housing units. Affordable housing in Whitestone is limited as a result, with most low income housing units located in neighboring areas. This being said, as low income communities are forced to move out and higher income families move in, rent will continue to increase as these new communities are able to afford housing with their salaries. As the employment rate and the resulting household incomes increase in Whitestone, renting becomes easier for high income families, and more challenging for low income ones.
