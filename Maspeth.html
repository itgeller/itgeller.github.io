  <h3>Low Income Housing Analysis</h3>

  <p>
     As more apartments are occupied in Manhattan, many are moving to other boroughs and into other neighborhoods like Maspeth. Just in the last year, Maspeth had an apartment search increase. A main contributor to this change was people deterring from the $4000+ per month price tag from an apartment in Manhattan, such as those in the East Side and SoHo. However, in retrospect, the rent price in Maspeth has increased. Comparing year to year, rent prices in Maspeth had a 9% increase. Currently, the average price for a one bedroom apartment is $1,800. Though the one bedroom apartment price is slightly cheaper than rent in NYC overall (which averages at around $4,200), realistically, the majority of renters in Maspeth are individuals with families. According to Zillow, a 2 or more bedroom apartment is around $2,500+ per month which is way more than most families could afford if considering the 19% poverty rate present. The price for an apartment might not be much for an individual who had previously resided in Manhattan, but it is for an individual who is local to the area and raising a family.

    <h4>Why is low income housing important in Maspeth?</h4>

    <p>
       As stated previously, Maspeth is a very residential area. It has a house occupancy rate of 91.45%, with only 8.55% of house vacancy. Half of the residents in Maspeth own their own house with 51.55% of homes being owner occupied and the lesser 48.45% being renter occupied. Most homes were made during the 1950’s and were constructed as multi-units so it can hold the most amount of residents. These multi unit homes were meant to be ideal for families looking for a place to rent with one family taking one floor and another family taking another.

Considering the concept of these multi homes and aforementioned poverty level in Maspeth being about 19%, with about 10% of the population under 18 identifying as “poor,” affordable housing is needed in Maspeth, especially in considering the rent increase that gentrification has caused in the recent year and the economic state of the country. Although  New York City has a reputation for being 26% more expensive than the rest of NY state, this year, the expense of living in the city has risen 3% due to high inflation.
