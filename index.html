  <h2 id="ranking">Ranking</h2>

  <p id="homeone">

   When assessing a neighborhood, the key elements that should be considered include Crime/Safety, Affordability, and Diversity. The neighborhoods in Queens that we chose have similarities in regards to the diversity ranking with each neighborhood scoring between the A/A+ range. In addition, Jamaica, Maspeth, and Whitestone have similar rankings in their affordability. The median cost for a  home in Jamaica is $590,000. The median cost for a home in Maspeth is $581,000. The median cost of a home in Bayside is $860,000. The median cost for a home in Whitestone is $505,000. The cost of living in Bayside is drastically higher due to differences in the cost of housing.These neighborhoods differ in their crime/safety. For the sake of this assessment, affordability would be the most significant ranking quality. Although diversity allows people to feel more included and comfortable, and lower crime rates make people feel safe, affordability takes precedence. The financial burden of expensive housing can lead to homelessness, debt, etc. These rankings should indicate how attractive these neighborhoods may be to a potential homeowner or renter. Based on someoneâ€™s priorities, people may choose to live in different neighborhoods; however , in our opinion the best choice is Whitestone based on its rankings.

  <h3 id="analysis">Low Income Housing Analysis</h3>

    When assessing a neighborhood, the key elements that should be considered include Crime/Safety, Affordability, and Diversity.  In addition, Jamaica, Maspeth, and Whitestone have similar rankings in their affordability. For the sake of this assessment, affordability would be the most significant ranking quality. Although diversity allows people to feel more included and comfortable, and lower crime rates make people feel safe, affordability takes precedence. The financial burden of expensive housing can lead to homelessness, debt, etc.  As a result of gentrification in Queens,  there is an increased demand for houses and rent pricing escalations, increasing low income communities to the vulnerability of evictions, correspondingly.  If gentrification causes the displacement of such communities, there is bound to be an increase in employment as more affluent populations are moving into the neighborhood as others are being pushed out. As a result, low income housing units and general affordable housing is limited within Bayside, Maspeth, and Whitestone. Therefore, we were unable to find our postal codes in the data set provided for all of our neighborhoods with the exception of Jamaica, Queens, as Jamaica is the only neighborhood within our data analysis set that we selected that has an entry for affordable housing. Jamaica indicates that there is no extended affordability provided, with a non-prevailing wage. There are little to no moderate or low units available in Jamaica, with income units only starting at middle income, totaling to only 10 available middle income housing income units. Given the current circumstances, as well as the economic circumstances surrounding the pandemic, gentrification will continue to cause an increase in affordable housing unit prices, causing for fewer and fewer affordable housing unit options. Our information shows that zip codes in Jamaica had the majority of their housing distributed in Extremely Low or Very Low income units showing that Jamaica provides access to units for lower income families. This information will be very useful for our final presentation.
